# odin-recipes

This is my first project for the fullstack web developer course that I follow in theodinproject.io. This first project aims to understanding more for html and using git as I already learn in past day. For the context this project, they asked me to make simple html page with list of recipes of food that I like. There are requirements for this html project:
1) The html page should have 2 page, the list of recipes page and the details of recipes.
2) Using attribute of ordered list (OL) and unordered list (UL).
3) Should have image in every recipes detail.
3) Also the page should have contain back track link to the main menu.
For this project, I commit to finish it only in 3 hours because the task is simple.
